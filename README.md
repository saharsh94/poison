# README - Decision Tree for Toxicology Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing material toxicity using a Decision Tree algorithm. The model predicts whether a material is poisoned based on its elemental composition. The implementation is provided as an interactive Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), making it easy to understand and adapt for further analysis.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it for your needs, and contribute to improve the project.
